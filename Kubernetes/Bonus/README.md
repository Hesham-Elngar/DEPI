# Kubernetes Controllers Lab Notes

## ðŸ”¹ What is the main difference between a ReplicationController and a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes?

- **ReplicaSet** is modern and faster.  
- **ReplicationController** can be considered as legacy or deprecated but still works.  

ðŸ‘‰ Think of it this way:  
- **ReplicationController** = old Nokia phone ðŸ“ž (still works, but outdated).  
- **ReplicaSet** = modern smartphone ðŸ“± (better features, faster, future-proof).  

---

## ðŸ”¹ If you delete a Pod managed by a ReplicaSet, what happens?

- ReplicaSet notices that and it immediately creates a new Pod to replace the deleted one.  
- The new Pod gets a different **name/UID**, but has the same **labels and spec** as defined in the ReplicaSetâ€™s template.

## ðŸ”¹ Why might you prefer a Deployment over a ReplicaSet in production?

- Because it supports **rolling out** and **rolling update** and can manage ReplicaSets.  

ðŸ‘‰ So in practice:  
- **ReplicaSet** = building block (used internally by Deployment).  
- **Deployment** = production-ready controller with advanced rollout/rollback features.
