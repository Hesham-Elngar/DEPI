What is the main difference between a ReplicationController and a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes?

ReplicaSet  is modern and faster ,ReplicationController can be considered as legacy or deprecated but still works

Think of it this way:

ReplicationController = old Nokia phone í³ž (still works, but outdated).

ReplicaSet = modern smartphone í³± (better features, faster, future-proof).[D[C

If you delete a Pod managed by a ReplicaSet, what happens?
ReplicaSet notices that and It immediately creates a new Pod to replace the deleted one
The new Pod gets a different name/UID, but has the same labels and spec as defined in the ReplicaSetâ€™s template.

Why might you prefer a Deployment over a ReplicaSet in production?


because it supports rolling out and rolling update and can manage replicasets

í±‰ So in practice:

ReplicaSet = building block (used internally by Deployment).

Deployment = production-ready controller with advanced rollout/rollback features.
