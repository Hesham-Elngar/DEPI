Part 3: ReplicaSet
Create a YAML file named `rs-nginx.yaml` that defines:
- A ReplicaSet named `nginx-rs`
- 3 replicas of Nginx version `1.21`
- Pods should be labeled with `app=nginx-rs`
Deploy the ReplicaSet.
Verify the ReplicaSet and Pods.
Scale the ReplicaSet to 4 replicas.
Check the number of Pods again.
Delete the ReplicaSet and verify Pods are also deleted.
