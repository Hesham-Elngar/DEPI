Kubernetes Lab Questions â€“ Pods, ReplicationController, and ReplicaSet
Part 1: Pod
Create a YAML file named `pod-nginx.yaml` that defines:
- A Pod named `nginx-pod`
- A single container running the latest `nginx` image
- The container should expose port 80
Deploy the Pod to the cluster. 
Verify that the Pod is running using `kubectl`.
Port-forward the Pod to access it locally on port 8080.
Open a browser and check if you can access the Nginx welcome page.
Delete the Pod.
Part 2: ReplicationController
Create a YAML file named `rc-nginx.yaml` that defines:
- A ReplicationController named `nginx-rc`
- 3 replicas of an Nginx Pod
- Pods should be labeled with `app=nginx`
Deploy the ReplicationController.
Verify the ReplicationController and all Pods are running.
Scale the ReplicationController to 5 replicas.
Check that new Pods are created.
Delete the ReplicationController and verify Pods are also deleted.
Part 3: ReplicaSet
Create a YAML file named `rs-nginx.yaml` that defines:
- A ReplicaSet named `nginx-rs`
- 3 replicas of Nginx version `1.21`
- Pods should be labeled with `app=nginx-rs`
Deploy the ReplicaSet.
Verify the ReplicaSet and Pods.
Scale the ReplicaSet to 4 replicas.
Check the number of Pods again.
Delete the ReplicaSet and verify Pods are also deleted.
Bonus Challenge
What is the main difference between a ReplicationController and a ReplicaSet in Kubernetes?
If you delete a Pod managed by a ReplicaSet, what happens?
Why might you prefer a Deployment over a ReplicaSet in production?
