Part 2: ReplicationController
Create a YAML file named `rc-nginx.yaml` that defines:
- A ReplicationController named `nginx-rc`
- 3 replicas of an Nginx Pod
- Pods should be labeled with `app=nginx`
Deploy the ReplicationController.
Verify the ReplicationController and all Pods are running.
Scale the ReplicationController to 5 replicas.
Check that new Pods are created.
Delete the ReplicationController and verify Pods are also deleted
